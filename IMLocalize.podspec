IMLocalize is used for localization inside your app.
Import IMLocalize to appDelegate (or some other class before you actually want to localize a string for the first time): #import @IMLocalize;
Set it up by just writing: [[IMLocalizeManager shared] setupWithUrlString:@"url_to_json_dictionaries"];
and then use it all over your app by just writing: IMLocalize(string_to_localize)
e.g: self.label.text = IMLocalize(string_to_localize);
